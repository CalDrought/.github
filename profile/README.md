# [Data for Drought Resiliency Capstone Project](https://bren.ucsb.edu/projects/data-drought-resiliency)


## Abstract
California is known for its susceptibility to drought. The State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) and Department of Water Resources (DWR) have collaborated to compile critical information such as water shortage outlooks, historical production and consumption datasets. While this data has been collected to predict and manage water supplies; historically it has remained isolated and poorly integrated. To address this gap, the California Natural Resource Agency (CNRA) developed a water data portal that provides drought related data, helping water managers with information to assess their water supply/demand needs and vulnerabilities.
This project aims to assess whether the historical and forecasted data is sufficient, useful, and accessible to better manage water resources.The team will perform data gap analyses and deliver recommendations from a data science perspective to enhance user experience. An automated workflow will be designed to help water resource managers and the public in visualizing and performing statistics to analyze the data. The ultimate goal is to collaborate with the California Water Data Consortium to improve understanding and provide an easily accessible resource for research and analysis in drought prevention.

### Data Source
The datasets used in this project originate from the California Natural Resources Agency. These files provide historical and forecasted data related to water shortage conditions, as well as water production and delivery across various water agencies in the state.

## Repositories in our project:

[Gap Analysis](https://github.com/CalDrought/gap_analysis)

Houses our gap analysis for urban drought data that is currently housed in a CNRA portal. Links to the original data can be found in the Urban Water Drought Data ReadMe. Includes an analysis of current data gaps, desired data, user usability, and training recommendations for staff.

[Dashboard](https://github.com/CalDrought/dashboard)

Houses the code for the dashboard section of the capstone project. This dashboard includes maps of California, graphs of water/ drought data, summary statistics, and an overview of missing values in the data. 

[Urban-Water-Drought-Data](https://github.com/CalDrought/urban-water-drought-data) 

Is a repo of the FlowWest github repository, which contains the data and metadata associated with this project.
