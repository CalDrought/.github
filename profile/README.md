# Data for Drought Resiliency Capstone Project


## Project Summary
California is known for its susceptibility to drought. The State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) and Department of Water Resources (DWR) have collaborated to compile critical information such as water shortage outlooks, historical production and consumption datasets. While this data has been collected to predict and manage water supplies; historically it has remained isolated and poorly integrated. To address this gap, the California Natural Resource Agency (CNRA) developed a water data portal that provides drought related data, helping water managers with information to assess their water supply/demand needs and vulnerabilities.
This project aims to assess whether the historical and forecasted data is sufficient, useful, and accessible to better manage water resources.The team will perform data gap analyses and deliver recommendations from a data science perspective to enhance user experience. An automated workflow will be designed to help water resource managers and the public in visualizing and performing statistics to analyze the data. The ultimate goal is to collaborate with the California Water Data Consortium to improve understanding and provide an easily accessible resource for research and analysis in drought prevention.

“This is a capstone project for the [Master of Environmental Data Science](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) at [Bren School of Environmental Science and Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/), University of California, Santa Barbara”

### Data Source
The datasets used in this project originate from the California Natural Resources Agency. These files provide historical and forecasted data related to water shortage conditions, as well as water production and delivery across various water agencies in the state.
